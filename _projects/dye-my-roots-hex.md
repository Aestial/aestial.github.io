### Testimonials
> "Going to Ms Kelly completely changed my life. It was always my dream to be in the beauty industry, but it was not considered a “real career” to some people in my life. Even though I was very hesitant at first to sign up, after coming up here for a walk threw and meeting Ms Kelly."
