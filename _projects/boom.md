We appreciate you take the time to play and review this 'Simon says' game experiment, it was originally intended to be a playground for student artists who wanted to grow their portfolio with a published game.

It certainly was designed to be a mobile game but keep it updated in stores is not easy task :P

All feedback is welcome so we can keep improving our work, thank you!

**Special thanks to my emotional and financial support <a href="https://dori.science" target="_blank">Dorita</a>!**
