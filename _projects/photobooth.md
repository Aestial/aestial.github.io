## About

This project consisted of two parts:

1. The Photo Booth User Interface which is a standalone Unity application with multi-touch gestures, featuring a real-time pocket photo printer and

2. A Wall projection made in TouchDesigner that triggers an animated gallery with the shape of logos made of all photos taken with the photo booth during the event.
