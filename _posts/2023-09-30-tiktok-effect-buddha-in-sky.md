## Background
A former colleague ask me to test TikTok sky segmentation right away for marketing purposes. They want to display some huge objects on top of an specific building, all rendered in the sky through an AR camera effect. 

## Approach
Effect House has never been so easy, it has several templates that have been updated side by side with Effect House versions. Now I'm using the Sky Segmentation template found on EH latest version.

Template features a castle in the sky laying over a piece of ground that took off from land and is now floating in the sky with (of course) some particles from the causing pandemonium. Those particles are going to be super useful for my purposes. A full sky replacement is featured in template, as a great example but I really want it to be as seamless as possible with current sky seen on video feed.

For that I used an AI *skybox* generator with really good fidelity to prompt and resolution ready to use in games and (like in this case) AR effects. Also I used a blend option for just tinting the real sky exactly where I want it: near Buddha's head.
