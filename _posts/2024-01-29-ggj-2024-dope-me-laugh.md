## Background

It's been seven years since my first GGJ at Lisbon and every year is funnier. That should be because I found better tools lately so I can focus on deliver a funny game loop instead of worrying about basic flow implementations.

## Process
*WIP*

To read more about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/dope-me-laugh/">this project description</a> please visit <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/">projects section.</a>

## Conclusion

I never been so happy with a GGJ project result, despite feeling complete, there are a lot of ways to improve this game and in an easy way using the Godot Engine.

**We :heart: OSS!!**
