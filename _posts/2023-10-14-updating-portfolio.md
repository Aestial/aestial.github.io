## Background

Today, I decided that there should be an easier and cheaper way to manage my personal website than hosting it on a shared server using Django, Postgres and DigitalOcean. Besides I didn't really like the way of delivering content into the blog and other collections like uploading and reference media files through the database for mention some.

For that reason, my former blog is almost unpopulated and in my humble opinion I'm wasting resources for the kind of web application that is hosted on all that infrastructure. I'm planning to use those resources for some kind of multiplayer game server completely customizable.

Populating project section has never being so easy this web framework is a bliss.
