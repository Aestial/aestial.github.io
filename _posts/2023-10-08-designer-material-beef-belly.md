Lately I've been feeling my guts and innards more than ever. So I decided to look on Google and ArtStation for some materials that depict organs and tissues but in a edible way, not only for zombie games.

Then I came with the idea of recreating some raw ingredients used in Mexican *cuisine* mainly in form of soups or tacos.

Have to mention that I feel really attracted to organic objects and textures with geometrical or fractal shapes. So the first choice is the tasteful beef belly.
